/**
we had a hard time starting this project, but finally had the opportunity to dissect it into different parts. The beginning is the creation of the main.c file which contains the main function. everything starts from this point, it is in fact the file which will be in charge of collecting the basic information, launching the shell and making line breaks. 
To start with linux, for a defined command, 3 parameters must be visible, namely:

-The input which corresponds to the standard input in the reasoning (STD_INT)

-The result expected at the end of the execution so the output, which corresponds to the standard output (STD_OUT)

-And the error expected when the input does not correspond to the input values recorded, which is associated with the standard error (STD_ERROR)

So we have in the main file enough system commands used to manage our shell. Namely SIGINT to register an interrupt signal (case of Ctr+C). 

For each task you'll have some precise comments on how to perform it!!


PS: We started on the basis of progressive contribution to allow both parties to control the process of realization of the shell from end to end. Of course it was difficult to get started, so we were inspired by explanations from our peers and old-timers to get started.
